### This is a simple full-stack Task Manager application built using C# (.NET 8) for the backend and React with TypeScript for the frontend.
It allows users to:
Add a new task
View all tasks
Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
Delete tasks

## The backend uses in-memory storage, and the frontend communicates with it using Axios.
